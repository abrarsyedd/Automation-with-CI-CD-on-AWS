# Project Steps: Automation with CI/CD on AWS

## üåü Key Features of the Project
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub repository triggers CodePipeline for automated builds.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Deployments are automated using AWS CodeDeploy.
- **Load Balancer Integration**: ALB ensures high availability and smooth traffic distribution.
- **Elasticity**: Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts instances based on demand.
- **Rollback Capabilities**: CodeDeploy allows automatic rollback in case of failures.
- **Monitoring and Notifications**: CloudWatch tracks performance, and SNS alerts for issues.

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **AWS Services**: CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, EC2, Auto Scaling, Application Load Balancer (ALB), CloudWatch, SNS.
- **Version Control**: GitHub.
- **Programming Language**: Node.js
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

## üìú Project Workflow

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Source Stage**
- **GitHub** is configured as the source repository for the application code.
- A **push to the repository** triggers the pipeline.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Test Stage**
- Use **CodeBuild or GitHub Actions** to build and test the code.
- **CodePipeline** ensures that only tested code moves forward.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Stage**
- **CodeDeploy** automates deployment to an Auto Scaling group.
- **ALB** performs health checks before routing traffic.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring and Notifications**
- **CloudWatch** monitors pipeline metrics and logs.
- **SNS** sends notifications for pipeline status or deployment failures.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup GitHub Repository**
- Create a **GitHub repository** with application code and **`appspec.yml`** for CodeDeploy.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ CodePipeline Configuration**
Define a pipeline in **AWS CodePipeline** with these stages:
- **Source**: Connect to the GitHub repository.
- **Build**: Use **CodeBuild** to build and test the application.
- **Deploy**: Deploy using **CodeDeploy** to an **Auto Scaling group**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ CodeDeploy Configuration**
- Configure **CodeDeploy** with ALB integration for **blue/green deployments**.
- Define **health check URLs** for ALB to validate successful deployments.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ ALB and Auto Scaling**
- Create an **Auto Scaling group** with EC2 instances running the application.
- Attach the **Auto Scaling group** to an **ALB** for load balancing.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring and Notifications**
- Configure **CloudWatch alarms** for pipeline errors and EC2 instance health.
- Use **SNS** to send alerts for pipeline events.

## üöß Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Handling deployment failures | Configured **CodeDeploy** to perform automatic rollbacks using **ALB health checks**. |
| Setting up seamless blue/green deployments | Used **CodeDeploy with ALB** for dynamic traffic shifting between deployment environments. |
| Scaling to handle varying traffic | Configured **Auto Scaling policies** based on **CPU utilization and ALB request counts**. |

## üéØ Learnings and Impact
- **Automated the software deployment process** using AWS CI/CD tools.
- Gained hands-on experience with **blue/green deployments** and **automated rollbacks**.
- Delivered a **robust and elastic architecture** that scales with user demand.
- Improved **deployment speed and reliability**, reducing human errors.
